# Serial Communication Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an explanation of the implementation of the `SerialCommunicationImpl.cpp` file. This class is designed to handle serial communication, specifically with an Arduino.

## Class Structure

The `SerialCommunicationChannel` class has the following methods:

- `initializeSerialCommunication`: Initializes the serial communication with a baud rate of 9600 and sets initial flags for message availability and delivery.

- `sendMessage`: Sends a given message over the serial communication channel and checks if the message is delivered.

- `isMessageDelivered`: Checks if a message is delivered.

- `sendEndMessage`: Sends an end message using the `sendMessage` method.

- `checkMessageAvailability`: Checks if there is any available message in the serial buffer.

- `getReceivedContent`: Retrieves the content of a received message, processes it, and returns the content.

- `setMessageAvailable`: Sets the flag indicating whether a message is available.

- `isMessageAvailable`: Checks if a message is available.

- `setMessageDelivered`: Sets the flag indicating whether a message is delivered.

- `processReceivedContent`: Processes the received content and handles special cases, such as an "end" message.

- `receivedEndMessage`: Sends a status message when an "end" message is received.

## Usage

The constructor of the `SerialCommunicationChannel` class performs the following actions:

1. Calls `initializeSerialCommunication` to set up the serial communication.

2. Calls `checkMessageAvailability` to check if there is any available message.

3. Calls `getReceivedContent` to retrieve and process any available message.

## Message Handling

- Messages are sent using the `sendMessage` method, and the delivery status is checked with `isMessageDelivered`.

- The `getReceivedContent` method retrieves the content of a received message, processes it (in this case, handling an "end" message), and returns the content.

- The `receivedEndMessage` method is called when an "end" message is received. It sends a status message over the serial communication channel.

## Conclusion

The `SerialCommunicationChannel` class provides a simple interface for serial communication with an Arduino, allowing the sending and receiving of messages with additional handling for special cases.
